<h2>5. Targeting Applications</h2>

<h3>The <code>Application</code> class</h3>

<p>The <code>Application</code> class represents an application to which Apple events will be sent. Its constructor allows applications to be identified in one of four ways: by full path, by eppc URL, by custom <code>AEAddressDesc</code>, or the host application if no other value is given. Its main method, <code>#event</code>, is used to construct the Apple events to send. Several utility methods are also provided.</p>

<pre><code>Application -- the target application

    Class methods:

        process_exists_for_path?(path) -- Does a local process launched
                from the specified application file exist?
            path : string -- application's path, e.g. '/Applications/iCal.app'
            Result : boolean -- Note: if path is invalid, an AE::MacOSError
                    is raised.

        process_exists_for_pid?(pid) -- Is there a local application process
                with the given Unix process id?
            pid : integer
            Result : boolean
		
        process_exists_for_url?(url) -- Does an application process specified
                by the given eppc:// URL exist?
            url : string -- url for remote process
                    (e.g. 'eppc://user:pass@0.0.0.1/TextEdit')
            Result : boolean -- Returns false if process doesn't exist, or if
                    access isn't allowed.

        process_exists_for_desc?(desc) -- Does an application process specified
                by the given AEAddressDesc exist?
            desc : AE::AEDesc -- AEAddressDesc for application
            Result : boolean -- Returns false if process doesn't exist, or if
                    access isn't allowed.

        launch(path) -- launch an application in background if not
                already running, and send it a 'ascrnoop' event
            path : string -- application's path, e.g. '/Applications/iCal.app'
    
    Constructors:

        by_path(path)
            path : string -- full path to local application
                    (e.g. '/Applications/TextEdit.app')

        by_pid(pid)
            pid : integer -- Unix process id

        by_url(url)
            url : string -- url for remote process
                    (e.g. 'eppc://user:pass@0.0.0.1/TextEdit')

        by_desc(desc)
            desc : AEDesc -- AEAddressDesc for application

        current -- the host process

    Methods:

        event(...) -- construct an Apple event (see next chapter for details)

        begin_transaction(session=nil) -- begin a new transaction;
                all Events constructed after begin_transaction is
                called will belong to the same transaction until
                end_transaction or abort_transaction is called
            session : anything -- optional value identifying the 
                    specific session (where supported)

        end_transaction -- end the current transaction

        abort_transaction -- abort the current transaction

        reconnect -- Make sure this Application object has a valid
                AEAddressDesc for the target application, relaunching
                the target application if it's not currently running.
                (Note: this only works for Application objects created
                via the by_path constructor.)</code></pre>


<h3>Creating <code>Application</code> objects</h3>

<p>When targeting a local application by path, the full path to the application (or application bundle) must be given, including a <code>.app</code> suffix if present. Note that aem identifies local applications by process serial number for reliability. If the target application is not already running when a new <code>Application</code> instance is created, it will be started automatically so that a PSN can be acquired. If the application can't be launched for some reason (e.g. if it's in the Trash), an <code>AEM::CantLaunchApplicationError</code> error will be raised.</p>

<p>If the <code>by_url</code> constructor is used, its <code>url</code> argument should be an eppc URL string. Aem will pack this as an <code>AEDesc</code> of <code>typeApplicationURL</code>. The target machine must have Remote Apple Events enabled in its Sharing preferences.</p>

<p>Clients can also supply their own <code>AEAddressDesc</code> if they prefer. This should be an <code>AE::AEDesc</code> of one of the following types:</p>

<pre><code>KAE::TypeApplicationBundleID
KAE::TypeApplicationURL
KAE::TypeApplSignature
KAE::TypeKernelProcessID
KAE::TypeMachPort
KAE::TypeProcessSerialNumber</code></pre>

<p>See the Apple Event Manager documentation for more information on these addressing modes.</p>


<h3>Launching applications</h3>

<p><code>Application.launch</code> is a class method attached to the <code>Application</code> class for convenience. It allows a non-running application to be launched without sending it the 'run' event (<code>aevtoapp</code>) normally sent to applications - a 'no-op' event (<code>ascrnoop</code>) is sent instead. It should be called before creating an <code>Application</code> object for the target application, otherwise the application will be launched as normal.</p>


<h3>Transactions</h3>

<p>The <code>#begin_transaction</code> and <code>#end_transaction</code> methods are used to start and stop transaction sessions for applications that support this. All events <em>created</em> while a transaction session is active will be identified as part of that transaction.</p>

<p>Note that during a transaction, sending the application an event not created during that transaction will cause an error. Similarly, sending the application an event created during a transaction after that transaction has ended will cause an error.</p>

<p>The <code>#end_transaction</code> method must be called to close both successful and failed transactions on completion. If a transaction session is accidentally left open, aem will attempt to close it when the <code>Application</code> object is garbage-collected, although this cannot be guaranteed to succeed.</p>


<h3>Reconnecting to local applications</h3>

<p>Because local applications are identified by process serial number, an existing <code>Application</code> object created using the <code>by_path</code> constructor will no longer hold a valid <code>AEAddressDesc</code> if the target application subsequently quits. Sending events to an invalid address will cause a <code>EventError</code> -600 ("application isn't running") or -609 ("connection is invalid") to be raised.</p>

<p>The <code>process_exists_for_path?</code> class method can be used to check if a local application is running or not, given its full path.</p>

<p>Calling the <code>#reconnect</code> method will create a new <code>AEAddressDesc</code> for an existing <code>Application</code> object that was originally created via the <code>by_path</code> constructor. If the application is not running at the time, it will be started automatically.</p>

<p>Note that only <code>Event</code> instances created after <code>#reconnect</code> is called will receive the new <code>AEAddressDesc</code>.  Any <code>Event</code> instances created before <code>reconnect</code> is called will still contain the old <code>AEAddressDesc</code>.</p>
