Combo Trainer WebApp
====================
Overview
--------

This is a Ruby On Rails WebApp that allows for users to train explicit timing of button sequences, commonly refered to as combos.

Running Version
---------------
To visit a live version on the site go [here](http://electric-window-8954.herokuapp.com).

Notes
-----
The hosted live version is slightly different from this source code. In this version, I am in the middle of adding a user authentication system so that user can have their own personal combos. The system works but there is bit of making sure that the right interface shows up at the right time (e.g. Log Off button only shows if the user is logged in).

Also future plans include support for multiple button combos. Currently all combos are done with the 'J' key, whereas the game has 6 buttons allocated for different attacks.
